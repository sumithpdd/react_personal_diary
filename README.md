# react_personal_diary
 basic personal diary app, which will utilize user authentication and authorization without the need for third-party services. Users can register for an account. Then, after they’re logged in, they’ll be able to create personal/private notes. Notes will be sorted by date, similar to blog posts—the most recent notes being displayed at the beginning of the list. Users will be able to preview, edit and delete each note. The content of the notes will be written in Markdown, and a convenient Markdown editor will be provided for that.
